*****LifeCycle of Components********************
* Compoenets births  - when we initialise a compoenent
* update to componeents - when click on somthing or change the prop or chnge the state
the component get updated.
* Then eventually it get unmounted thats Death of a compoenents.


******How React works Internally******************************************
JSX-----> virtual DOM ----> DOM

* we write our template in JSX, which is the html lookin code, that get converted into react objects.
* And recat objects get converted into somthing called virtual DOMS.
* DOM is html page the Documents objects model
* So prior to React all the other framework would directly update the DOM, html when there is change in componenet which 
is exteremly difficult to track, bcause traversing thorugh html DOM is always expensive. So React came uo with cool concept of virtual dom.
* Virtual DOM keeps another tree of javaScript object, whene there is cahnge or update to your page chnage in prop or state it figure out smartly
what has been updated, it would only update that part of virtual DOM and DOM get repainted to page, So u dont direcelty updated to DOM.
